# MullvadChecker
Simple python script to check mullvad accounts.
Usage
python mull.py

Then either paste all your accs into acc.txt file and chose the Check file option or choose the second option and paste them there manually.
Valid keys will be saved in valid_mull.txt, valid means also not expired as it checks for the current date and the expire date of the accs.
You need to have installed mullvad app on your pc/vm/vps as it uses the mullvad cli to login into the account and check for info.
